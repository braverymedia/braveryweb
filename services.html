    <h1>Now is the time to <br>lead with Bravery.</h1>
    <article class="page-intro">
      <p class="is-large">Your institutional website shouldn't be a loss-leader for enrollment. Your college or
        university website should be the most profitable and hardest-working part of your marketing budget. Why pay
        $150,000 or more for a website redesign that doesn't get results? Every penny spent on a new website,
        digital
        viewbook, or virtual tour should be accounted for.</p>
      <h2>Digital Strategy + Design Proven for Success</h2>
      <p>Bravery Media is a full-service strategy and design agency that’s helped colleges and universities at every
        level
        improve their digital marketing. With decades of
        combined higher ed marketing experience, Bravery provides the perfect mix of quality, speed, and
        results-driven expertise to help you attract more students, convey your brand promise, and improve your

          <h2>The Best Value in Higher Ed Digital</h2>
          <p>We're proud to provide outstanding return on
            investment, but even more proud that our human-centric, research-based approach to digital strategy
            and design organically surpasses the goals our clients set. How did we generate more than 5700&times; ROI

            emotion and baggage. We build in affordances, make our strategy inclusive, and extend dignity to the real
            human beings that interact with our work.</p>
          <p>Placing personal value on your audience members translates into unbelievable financial and brand value for
            your institution. It's a matter of hospitality. It's a matter of respect. And it really is that simple.</p>
