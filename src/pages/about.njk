      <h2>Global impact, Austin roots, remote-first</h2>
      <p>Bravery Media was founded in 2012 as a higher education-focused web strategy and design agency in the capital city of Austin, TX. Our proximity to world-class institutions, one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the USA, and a vibrant creative scene provide Bravery with unmatched access to the best technical and design minds in the world.</p>
      <p>While initially, headquartered in Austin, our team and independent partners are spread across the United States, Canada, the UK, and Europe.</p>
      <p>Combined, our team members have worked on hundreds of websites across the higher education, B2B, hospitality, e-commerce, and consumer sectors. Our work is beautiful and performs at the highest levels for millions of web users every day. What other higher ed agency can say the same?</p>
