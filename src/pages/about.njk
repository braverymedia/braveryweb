      <h2>Global impact, Austin roots, remote-first</h2>
      <p>Bravery Media was founded in 2012 as a higher education-focused web strategy and design agency in the capital city of Austin, TX. Our proximity to world-class institutions, one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the USA, and a vibrant creative scene provided Bravery with unmatched access to the best technical and design minds in the world.</p>
      <p>Now our team and independent partners are spread across the United States, Canada, the UK, and Europe. This wide net provides even more opportunity to learn from and partner with educators, designers, technologists, and institutions.</p>
      <p>Combined, our team members have worked on hundreds of websites across the higher education, B2B, hospitality, e-commerce, and consumer sectors. Our work is beautiful and performs at the highest levels for millions of web users every day. What other higher ed agency can say the same?</p>
