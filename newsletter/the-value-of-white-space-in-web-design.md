In web design, white space isn’t just an empty void waiting to be filled; it serves a crucial purpose.

White space conveys a sense of sophistication and quality. By using it strategically, institutions can create an impression of exclusivity and value. Think Apple or Porsche. It also helps capture and keep attention. White space enables colleges and universities to present one element at a time, which reduces both clutter and cognitive load for users.

It also has a huge impact on conversion rate optimization efforts. We’ve seen remarkable CRO increases for clients by streamlining content hierarchies and using generous amounts of white space. Which makes sense, right? By simplifying the whole experience, it’s a lot easier for users to navigate and comprehend information. 

Embracing white space requires an understanding of what prospects expect to see, and knowing that their needs are all different. It places UX on a pedestal while still maintaining a clear purpose. But if done right, it’ll result in a website that strikes the right balance between aesthetic appeal, accessibility, and conversation rates.

And that’s good for everyone.
