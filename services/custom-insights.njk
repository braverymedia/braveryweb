      <p>Sometimes you need targeted insights to bolster the strategy you already have in place. Bravery can help. We start with a needs assessment to make sure we're only delivering information that is actionable and valuable to your institution. From there, we prepare a report with data and recommendations featuring some of the following research:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Facilitated Usability Studies</li>
        <li>Heuristic Evaluations</li>
        <li>Terminology Reviews</li>
        <li>User Journey Mapping</li>
        <li>Jobs to be Done Studies</li>
        <li>Service Blueprints</li>
        <li>Homepage Brand Review</li>
        <li>Technical Assessment (SEO, Accessibility, Content Strategy)</li>
        <li>Environment Assessment (Competitor audits, brand positioning, regional industry data)</li>
        <li>Operational Assessment (Governance planning, staff needs modeling, budget modeling)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of these are more time-intensive than others. Our pricing is tailored to precisely what you need. Have strict budget allowances? Let's talk about what will give you the biggest return on that investment.</p>

    <h2>It all starts with your needs</h2>
    <p>Every dollar (or pound, or euro) in your budget is important. Rather than trying to force a template on your institution, Bravery wants to understand precisely what your institution needs. Our Needs Assessment gets us most of the way to understanding what research fits you best, now. A follow-up conversation helps our team uncover the biggest challenges your institution is facing.</p>
    <p><a href="#" role="button" tabindex="0" data-cal-link="team/bravery/needs-assessment">Schedule a Needs Assessment</a> and we'll provide our initial recommendations and a price range. You can schedule a conversation with us, or not. It's your choice. We promise not to bug you with sales emails (we just don't do that).</p>
