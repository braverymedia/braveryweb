    <h2>It all starts with your needs</h2>
    <p>Every dollar (or pound, or euro) in your budget is important. Rather than trying to force a template on your institution, Bravery wants to understand precisely what your institution needs. Our Needs Assessment gets us most of the way to understanding what research fits you best, now. A follow-up conversation helps our team uncover the biggest challenges your institution is facing.</p>
    <p><a href="/contact/">Start a conversation with us</a> and we'll provide our initial recommendations and a price range. You can schedule a conversation with us, or not. It's your choice. We promise not to bug you with sales emails (we just don't do that).</p>
